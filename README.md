# OffTheRecordPatch
This is a patch for Dead Rising 2: Off The Record that brings some quality of life improvements to the game.

## Features

* Setting to skip startup logos.
* Adjustable frame limiter - can be disabled.
* Cinematic animations are no longer stuck at 30 frames per second and can be adjusted.
* Single/customizable core options for game stability that perform significantly better than doing it via Task Manager CPU affinity.
* Some random cheats, such as the ability to play as Chuck Greene in singleplayer, have everything unlocked and sprinting.
